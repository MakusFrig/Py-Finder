# Py-Finder
This is a very small repository for a very small project. About a year ago, when just learning python I wanted to improve the sppeed at which I could find files on windows as the file explorer took way too long. Today I am using linux and the idea crossed my mind to create this project now that i have mroe experience with recursion which is what i used to search the file system
